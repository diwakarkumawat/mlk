Define a data model in JPA.

There are Charities, Donors, and Donations as the basic data model, plus CharityGoals.

Each Donation has a many-to-one relationship to Charity and Donor.  Likewise, Charity and Donor are each one-to-many with Donation.

Each Charity has a name

Each Donor has a firstName, lastName

Each Donation has a date and an amount.

Charity has a many to many relationship to CharityGoal.

Each CharityGoal has a name.

Prepopulate CharityGoal with values such as “Feed the hungry”, “Protect animals”, “Save the Children”, “Rescue those in trouble”, “Save the planet”, “Medical research”

Prepopulate Charity with values such as “ASPCA”, “RedCross”, “American Cancer Society”

Prepopulate Donor with values such as “Jack” “Jones”, “John” “Smith”, “Helen” “Smith”, and “Sally” “Underhill”.

Create a REST server using Java, which supports GET endpoints that fetch Charities, Donations, and Donors.

Implement the REST server using framework of your choice, preferably Jersey.

Implement a POST endpoint that links a Charity to a CharityGoal.  Remember that that GET for Charity will need to return the list of CharityGoal(s) for the Charity.

Implement a POST endpoint that creates a new Donation, with date and amount.

Implement a GET endpoint that given a charityID, returns a list of the 10 Donors who gave the most in Donations.

Implement a GET endpoint that given a donorId, a fromDate and a toDate, returns the list of Donations for that Donor in the given time period.
